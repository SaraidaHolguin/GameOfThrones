# IBM Game Of Thrones Demo

This demo allows you to predict who will be the ruler of Westeros in the TV series, Game of Thrones.
This prediction is based on three data sheets, two from kaggle.com and one created by data found on the Game of Thrones site. 

The conditions that are used to generate this prediction are boats by family, Army size by family && allegiance, whether there is a supernatural influence on the character, whether the character is an heir of the throne, whether the character is currently leading an army, and how many allegiances the character has. These can be changed and so can the weight that determines their percentage influence.

This was made using IBM services such as dashDB found on IBM Bluemix and RStudio found on IBM Data Science Experience.

This data is later pushed into Watson Analytics for further observation.
